% \begin{package}{}{cm}{Computer Modern fonts.}
% Knuth's final iteration of his re-interpretation of a c.19
% Modern-style font from Monotype. The family is comprehensive,
% offering both sans and roman styles, and a monospaced font,
% together with mathematics fonts closely integrated with the
% mathematical facilities of {\TeX} itself. The base fonts are
% distributed as Metafont source, but autotraced PostScript Type
% 1 versions are available (one version in the AMS fonts
% distribution, and also the BaKoMa distribution). The Computer
% Modern fonts have inspired many later families, notably the
% European Computer Modern and the Latin Modern families.

\begin{package}{pplbj8r}{fpl: TeXPalladioL-BoldOsF}{SC and OsF fonts for URW Palladio L}
The FPL Fonts provide a set of SC/OsF fonts for URW Palladio L
which are compatible with respect to metrics with the Palatino
SC/OsF fonts from Adobe. Note that it is not my aim to exactly
reproduce the outlines of the original Adobe fonts. The SC and
OsF in the FPL Fonts were designed with the glyphs from URW
Palladio L as starting point. For some glyphs (e.g. 'o') I got
the best result by scaling and boldening. For others (e.g. 'h')
shifting selected portions of the character gave more
satisfying results. All this was done using the free font
editor FontForge. The kerning data in these fonts comes from
Walter Schmidt's improved Palatino metrics. {\LaTeX} use is
enabled by the mathpazo package, which is part of the psnfss
distribution.

%\begin{package}{}{mathpazo}{Fonts to typeset mathematics to match Palatino.}
%The Pazo Math fonts are a family of PostScript fonts suitable

%fonts provided in Adobe Type~1 format (PazoMath, PazoMath-
%Italic, PazoMath-Bold, PazoMath-BoldItalic, and
%PazoMathBlackboardBold). These contain, in designs that match
%Palatino, glyphs that are usually not available in Palatino and
%for which Computer Modern looks odd when combined with
%Palatino. These glyphs include the uppercase Greek alphabet in
%upright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, the
%lowercase Greek alphabet in slanted shape in regular and bold
%weights, several mathematical glyphs (partialdiff, summation,
%product, coproduct, emptyset, infinity, and proportional) in
%regular and bold weights, other glyphs (Euro and dotlessj) in
%upright and slanted shapes in regular and bold weights, and the
%uppercase letters commonly used to represent various number
%sets (C, I, N, Q, R, and Z) in blackboard bold. The set also
%includes a set of 'true' small-caps fonts, also suitable for
%use with Palatino (or one of its clones). {\LaTeX} macro support
%(using package mathpazo.sty) is provided in psnfss (a required

% \begin{package}{}{cfr-lm}{Enhanced support for the Latin Modern fonts.}
% The package supports a number of features of the Latin Modern
% fonts which are not easily accessible via the default (La){\TeX}
% support provided in the official distribution. In particular,
% the package supports the use of the various styles of digits
% available, small-caps and upright italic shapes, and
% alternative weights and widths. It also supports variable width
% typewriter and the ``quotation'' font. Version 2.004 of the Latin
% Modern fonts is supported. By default, the package uses
% proportional oldstyle digits and variable width typewriter but
% this can be changed by passing appropriate options to the
% package. The package also supports using (for example)
% different styles of digits within a document so it is possible
% to use proportional oldstyle digits by default, say, but
% tabular lining digits within a particular table. The package
% requires the official Latin Modern distribution, including its
% (La){\TeX} support. The package relies on the availability of both
% the fonts themselves and the official font support files. The
% package also makes use of the nfssext-cfr package. Only the T1
% and TS1 encodings are supported for text fonts. The set up of
% fonts for mathematics is identical to that provided by Latin
% Modern.

% u) correspond to Roman letters: the font encodes these to the
% corresponding roman letter. The remaining 79 characters have
% been arbitrarily encoded in the range 38-122; the cherokee
% package provides commands that map each such syllable to the
% appropriate character; for example, Segwoya himself would be
% represented CseCgwoCya.

% also includes Unicode virtual fonts for use with Omega. The
% font set is not a replacement for any of the other Computer
% Modern-based font sets (for example, cm-super for Latin and
% Cyrillic, or cbgreek for Greek), since it is available at a
% single size only; it offers a compact set for 'general'
% working. The fonts themselves are encoded to external

% from Latin (Metafont ec, tc, vnr), Cyrillic (lh), Greek
% (cbgreek when available) code sets and IPA extensions (from
% tipa). This font set contains 33 fonts. This archive contains

\begin{package}{ec-cyklopi}{cyklop: Cyklop-Italic}{The Cyclop typeface.}
The Cyclop typeface was designed in the 1920s at the workshop
of Warsaw type foundry ``Odlewnia Czcionek J. Idzkowski i S-ka''.
This sans serif typeface has a highly modulated stroke so it
has high typographic contrast. The vertical stems are much
heavier then horizontal ones. Most characters have thin
rectangles as additional counters giving the unique shape of
the characters. The lead types of Cyclop typeface were produced
in slanted variant at sizes 8-48 pt. It was heavily used for
heads in newspapers and accidents prints. Typesetters used
Cyclop in the inter-war period, % during the occupation in the
% underground press. The typeface was used until the beginnings
% of the offset print and computer typesetting era. Nowadays it
% is hard to find the metal types of this typeface. The font was
% generated using the Metatype1 package. Then the original set of
% characters was completed by adding the full set of accented
% letters and characters of the modern Latin alphabets (including
% Vietnamese). The upright variant was generated and it was more
% complicated task than it appeared at the beginning. 11 upright
% letters of the Cyclop typeface were presented in the book by
% Filip Trzaska, ``Podstawy techniki wydawniczej'' (``Foundation of
% the publishing techonology''), Warsaw 1967. But even the author
% of the book does not know what was the source of the presented
% examples. The fonts are distributed in the Type1 and OpenType
% formats along with the files necessary for use these fonts in

mathematics in conjunction with a variety of text fonts which
do not provide mathematical character sets of their own. Euler-%
VM is a set of virtual mathematics fonts based on Euler and CM.
This approach has several advantages over immediately using the
real Euler fonts: Most noticeably, less {\TeX} resources are
consumed, the quality of various math symbols is improved and a
usable hslash symbol can be provided. The virtual fonts are
accompanied by a {\LaTeX} package which makes them easy to use,
particularly in conjunction with Type1 PostScript text fonts.
They are compatible with amsmath. A package option allows the
fonts to be loaded at 95{\%} of their nominal size, thus blending
better with certain text fonts, e.g., Minion.

\begin{package}{phaistos}{phaistos}{Disk of Phaistos font.}
A font that contains all the symbols of the famous Disc of
Phaistos, together with a {\LaTeX} package. The disc was 'printed'
by stamping the wet clay with some sort of punches, probably
around 1700 BCE. The font is available in Adobe Type~1 and
OpenType formats % (the latter using the Unicode positions for
% the symbols). There are those who believe that this Cretan
% script was used to 'write' Greek (it is known, for example,

collection of diacritical characters in the attempt to cover as
many Latin-based scripts as possible. To our knowledge, the
repertoire of characters covers all European languages as well

sufficient for typesetting of romanized transliterations of
Arabic and Sanskrit scripts. % The Antykwa Poltawskiego family
